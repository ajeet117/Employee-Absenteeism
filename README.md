# Project overview
This project was created to learn and explore data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling for employee absenteeism, and to practice building interactive visual analytics in Power BI. It includes two Jupyter notebooks for data prep and modeling, plus guidance to create a Power BI report showcasing key insights and model interpretability

# Learning objectives
By working with this project, the following skills are practiced:

Data preparation — parsing dates, deriving calendar features, encoding categorical fields, and validating distributions.

Predictive modeling — standardizing numeric fields, fitting logistic regression, and interpreting coefficients as odds ratios.

BI visualization — importing CSVs, shaping data types, and designing clear, interactive Power BI dashboards for business stakeholders.
